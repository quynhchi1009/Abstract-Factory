# Abstract-Factory
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- Explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family
-> make all variants of products follow those interfaces

- Use when your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you donâ€™t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products

! Abstract Factory classes are often based on a set of Factory Methods
! Abstract Factory specializes in creating families of related objects
! Abstract Factory returns the product immediately
